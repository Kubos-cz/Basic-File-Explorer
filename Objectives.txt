WPF + VMMV

We want an application that shows a view of the C:\ folder with a TreeView that contains the folders and files combined together in one tree.
Only the names of the folders and files need to be shown.
Protected system files and folders should not be displayed.

Here are the required features:

- The UI should show up quickly.
- The UI should not freeze when expanding large folders in the tree.
- Any I/O operation or computational operation should be done asynchronously to avoid locking up the UI.

- Display information about the selection in the status bar:

    - The first will be the number of items in the selected folder's immediate children.
      This number is the same number you see in Explorer's status bar when you select a folder in the left pane. If you select a file, then it's simply "1 item".


    - If a file is selected, the 2nd item in the status bar is the size of the file selected.
    - If a folder is selected, the 2nd item in the status bar will be the count of files and folders contained in that folder recursively, and the size of the entire folder.

    - If you select another folder while the values from the previous folder are still being calculated, you need to stop that operation and restart with the newly selected folder.
    - Bonus if you can show progress of the calculations in the status bar. (For example, right-click on C:\Windows in Explorer, select Properties, and see how Explorer shows progress in the Properties dialog.)
    - See the XAML for an idea of the format of the text, or you can also copy the format in Windows 10 Explorer's status bar.

- Add an option to toggle whether hidden files/folders are shown (like the "Hidden items" in Explorer). Bonus if you can avoid having the TreeView reset and lose currently expanded folders.
- Bonus if you want to display the file's icon, and sort the folders and files the same way as Explorer (name ascending-only is OK).

- Code style is important. We like the standard C# style you get with Visual Studio out-of-the-box and recommended by Microsoft.
